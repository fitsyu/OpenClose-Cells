If I think about it, I found my self frequently in urge need for this kind of feature.

Many times, I want a cell that grows in size (height) when it is touched and turns back to its original size when it's touched again.

So this is not library.

It is not something that imported and solves the problem of the day.

It is rather just an example to further be customized as much as you want to fit your specific needs.

Example usecases for this kind of feature is:

- FAQs

    initially show all list of question `closed`
    
    tap the cell to `open` it and see the answer
  
- Multi Options

    initially show all list of options `closed`
    
    tap the cell to `open` the options editor
